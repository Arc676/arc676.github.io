# arc676.github.io: My website
This mainly exists so I can have a URL on my StackOverflow profile. Also, this allows me to have a single location for my profile instead of having a GitHub profile, a StackExchange profile, etc.

Also this is where I intend to share stuff that isn't strictly code. I could sign up for free web hosting elsewhere and get PHP... but I'm too lazy to set up more accounts just for the advantages of interactive webpages and server side code... This isn't my primary focus anyway. Besides, apparently JS fetch is also good for loading HTML files into other HTML files and can effectively replace PHP's 'include' function.

Here, you will find the following, posted at arbitrary intervals (i.e. whenever I feel like it) and with no real overarching topic (literally any decently written crap I don't know where to put could end up here).
- Tutorials
- Brief descriptions about my projects
- Some stuff about me
- Other arbitrary stuff
