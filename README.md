This mainly exists so I can have a URL on my StackOverflow profile. Also, this allows me to have a single location for my profile instead of having a GitHub profile, a 
StackExchange profile, etc.

Also this is where I intend to share stuff that isn't strictly code. I could sign up for free web hosting elsewhere and get PHP... but I'm too lazy to set up more accounts 
just for the advantages of interactive webpages and server side code.. This isn't my primary focus anyway. Besides, apparently jQuery is also good for loading HTML files 
into other HTML files and can effectively replace PHP's 'include' function.
