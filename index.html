			GitHub-hosted pages do not have access to server-side code such as PHP. This website uses the Fetch API to dynamically load the navigation bar. You won't 
			be able to navigate the site using hyperlinks if you disable JavaScript. If you're doing it for security reasons, I assure you there is no malicious JavaScript 
			here. First, it would be against GitHub's terms and conditions. Second, you can always just view page source and see for yourself.
