		<li>Like retro gaming? Check out my remake of the classic game Pong <a href="/projects/projects.html#PongRevived">for Mac</a>!</li>
		<li>I'm on Twitter now. Follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/2Arc676">@2Arc676</a> (yes there's an extra 2 in there) for regular updates regarding my 
projects with the hashtag #Arc676Apps.</li>
		<li>Crystal Ball is coming to Linux, but I'm not sure when. Qt and Snapcraft are really hard (or I'm really stupid and/or used to other IDEs and app deployment technologies).</li>
		<li>I'm working on a new <a href="/projects/projects.html#OrxVice">project</a>: a top-down shooter using the open source game engine <a href="http://orx-project.org">Orx</a>.
