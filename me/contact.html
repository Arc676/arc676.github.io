			There are a few ways you might have gotten to this website.
			<ul>
				<li>I include this website in some of my social media profiles. Therefore, you should already be able to contact me on that platform.</li>
				<li>You got here from my StackOverflow profile. If you want to discuss my posts there, you should comment instead. If you want to have an extended conversation, you can ask me to join you in chat on StackOverflow.</li>
				<li>You were looking through my GitHub repositories. You can comment on those (I think) if you want to discuss my projects. If you <i>really</i> want to email me, my email address is in all the source files.</li>
			</ul>
			In other words, I'm not actually going to give away any contact information on this page because all valid reasons for wanting to contact me would have resulted in alternative means of communication or you coming into possession of my email address before reaching this page.<br>
			<b>Do not send me spam.</b> Be respectful. I only included my email in the source code files because the convention is to include your email so people can contact you about your code.

			If you're interested in receiving updates about my projects, consider following me on <a href="https://github.com/Arc676">GitHub</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/2Arc676">Twitter</a>. Whenever a project reaches a significant milestone, I tweet about it with a hashtag with the app name and also #Arc676Apps.
