			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman">Hangman</a> is a popular puzzle game where one player chooses a secret phrase (usually a single word) and reveals the number of letters in it. Any number of other players guess single letters at a time to determine the secret. If the letter appears in the secret, all instances of it are revealed. The Rust crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/Rustic_Hangman">Rustic Hangman</a> provides the backend for Hangman games. The same repository includes a command line frontend. A QML frontend is also available for Linux platforms; the app is designed for Ubuntu Touch.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hangman is written in Rust. The Linux version is a QML/Rust application. This can be used on Ubuntu Touch as well as desktop Linux platforms.
