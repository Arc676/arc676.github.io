			Dicey Dungeons (pending rename) is a strategy board game written using the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy Engine</a> and created for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-1">first Bevy game jam</a>. The theme was Unfair Advantage. In this game, the players spawn on a randomly generated map and race each other to the goal. However, the dice are weighted! Items are randomly scattered throughout the map and can be used to gain an edge over the other players by changing the weights on your dice, or your opponents' dice. Boost your own rolls and cripple your opponents' rolls to get to the finish before they do!
