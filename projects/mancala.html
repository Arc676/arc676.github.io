		<p>
			The repository contains both a backend library and command-line frontend program for playing the game Mancala. The library can be reused to design a new frontend without having to write the backend logic. For more details, see the README.

		<p>
			Mancala is a strategy game in which pebbles are moved around a board. Full gameplay rules can be found in the man page. This is a command line version of that game for low performance computers or if you want to play while in a Terminal without starting X. The computer player prioritizes these moves, in this order:
			<ul>
				<li>Captures</li>
				<li>Extra turns</li>
				<li>Preventing the opponent from capturing pebbles</li>
				<li>Preventing the opponent from taking extra turns</li>
				<li>Picking the pocket farthest from the goal</li>
			</ul>
			This does not appear to be an optimal algorithm for winning at Mancala. If you can do better, feel free to fork the repository and work on it yourself. Make a pull request and I'll merge if the algorithm works.

			Mancala is written in C and should be compilable on any platform.
