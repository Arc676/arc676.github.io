			Pong: Revived is my remake of the classic 1972 Atari arcade game Pong. It's available for Mac but I'm working on an iOS version. It has many features such as colors, customizable mechanics, cheat codes, and more. See the README for more info. In case you somehow haven't heard of Pong, it's a game where you have two paddles controlled by two players and a ball. Move your paddle to hit the ball. If you miss, your opponent scores a point. First to 10 wins. The mechanics are a lot like tennis, except the net doesn't actually do anything.
