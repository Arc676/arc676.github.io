			Jump is based on <a href="https://xkcd.com/1376/">the XKCD comic of the same name</a>. It was created for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/xkcdgamejam">XKCD Game Jam</a>. The objective is to collect all the yellow spheres. It's a simple game, but the primary mechanic is that when you jump, gravity only slows you down until your vertical velocity is 0. Press SPACE for longer to jump higher.

				<li>Mac
				<li>Windows
				<li>Linux
