			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack">Blackjack</a> is a popular casino card game where the objective is to obtain a hand of greater value than that of the dealer without exceeding a value of 21 points, which is known as busting. The backend library is written in Rust but designed to be linkable with C. The Mac frontend is written in Objective-C and the Ubuntu Touch frontend is a QML/Rust application. Both frontends are currently in development. Developed with the help of <a href="https://gitlab.com/Fatcat560">Fatcat560</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The library and command line frontend are written in Rust and should be compatible on any platform.
		</p>
		<p>
			Platform availability:
			<ul>
				<li>Mac (in development)
				<li>Linux, Ubuntu Touch (in development)
			</ul>
