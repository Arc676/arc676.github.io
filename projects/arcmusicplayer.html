			The Arc Music Player is a lightweight, simple, bare-bones music player. It doesn't create libraries or sort your music and only has the absolute basics of a music player. This makes it small and easy to use while still providing most of the functionality required of a music player. See the README file for more details on available features. It works by creating playlists in the form of lists of paths to music files.

			Platform availability:
			<ul>
				<li>Mac
				<li>Linux
			</ul>
			In release 1.0, the Mac and Linux versions did not have compatible save formats. The new releases, currently in development, <i>do</i> have the same save format for playlists.
