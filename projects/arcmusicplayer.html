			The Arc Music Player is a lightweight, simple music player. It doesn't create libraries or sort your music and only has the absolute basics of a music player. This makes it small and easy to use while still providing most of the functionality required of a music player. See the README file for more details on available features. This app is useful when you have all your music in one place and don't want to copy it so that more than one application can access it. For example, if you have an iTunes library that you want to access on a separate partition (e.g. one running a different version of Mac), you can use the Arc Music Player instead of having two separate iTunes libraries for each version of Mac.

			Platform availability:
			<ul>
				<li>Mac
				<li>Linux (downloadable as a snap package)
			</ul>
			As of release 1.0, the Mac and Linux versions do not have compatible save formats. This may change in future releases.
