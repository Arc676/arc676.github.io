			The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Amazons">Game of the Amazons</a> is a board game in a similar family to go and chess. It was invented in 1988 by Walter Zamkauskas in Argentina. This project was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjSOSeRZVNg">this Numberphile video</a> and consists of a backend library and command line frontend written in C, as well as graphical frontends for Mac and Ubuntu Touch. Refer to the READMEs, the YouTube video, or the Wikipedia page for details regarding gameplay.
		</p>
		<p>
			The backend library is written in C and should be compatible with any platform. The frontend can also be run in the command line on any platform. Graphical frontends are platform specific.
		</p>

			Platform availability:
			<ul>
				<li>iOS (potentially, but unlikely)
				<li>Mac
				<li>Ubuntu Touch
			</ul>
