		<p>
			Pixel Shootout is my first project using the open source game engine, <a href="http://orx-project.com">Orx</a>. It's a top-down shooter in which enemies spawn randomly and they have to be shot for points. You can download the Mac version from GitHub or <a href="https://arc676.itch.io/pixel-shootout">itch.io</a>. Windows and Linux binaries might be coming soon, but the project is still in early development.
		</p>
		<p>
			The repository contains an Xcode project and I will likely only include Mac binaries in the releases, but this project can be compiled on any Orx-compatible platform. You will have to download a compiled version of Orx for your platform (or compile it yourself) and link it when compiling.
