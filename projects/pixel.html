		<p>
			Pixel Shootout is my first project using the open source game engine, <a href="http://orx-project.com">Orx</a>. It's a top-down shooter in which enemies spawn randomly and they have to be shot for points. (Still in early development).
		</p>
		<p>
			The repository contains an Xcode project and I will likely only include Mac binaries in the releases, but Orx can be compiled on any platform so this project can too. You will have to download a compiled version of Orx for your platform (or compile it yourself) and link it when compiling.
