		<p>
			The Matrix library provides matrix functions and encapsulates their representation. Consult the header files for more information regarding the provided functionality. The repository also includes a simple frontend that interfaces with the library. This frontend might not, however, provide access to all the library's functions, as it's mainly used for testing.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Matrix library is a C library and should be compatible with any platform. If there are any issues, please <a href="https://github.com/Arc676/Matrix-Library/issues/new">report them</a>.
