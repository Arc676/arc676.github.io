			The Matrix library provides matrix functions and encapsulates their representation. Consult the header files for more information regarding the provided functionality. The primary repository also includes two frontends that interface with the library. The first frontend provides more basic functionality. The second is more powerful, allowing arbitrary calculations to be performed by describing them in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse Polish Notation</a> and allowing matrices to be saved in memory for reuse. However, this second frontend is less robust, as fewer checks have been put in place to prevent crashes due to faulty input.

			The QML frontend is a graphical interface to the Matrix library designed for Ubuntu Touch. Developed in collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/El3ctroGh0st">El3ctroGh0st</a>.

			The Matrix library is a C library and should be compatible with any platform. If there are any issues, please <a href="https://github.com/Arc676/Matrix-Library/issues/new">report them</a>. The QML frontend is designed for Ubuntu Touch.
