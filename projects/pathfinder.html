			Project Pathfinder involves the creation of a C++ library for graph related functions such as creating, modifying, storing, and loading weighted graphs as well as applying path-finding algorithms to determine the shortest route between any two nodes of a graph. Graphs are stored in plain text; graph data can be written to and read from string variables. See the README for the full feature list and available algorithms.
		</p>
		<p>
			GraphBuilder is a Cocoa frontend to the Pathfinder library for Mac. It's written in Objective-C++ to allow compatibility with the C++ library. It allows users to visually create graphs and find optimal paths between nodes.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Pathfinder library can be compiled on any platform. If there are any troubles compiling on any platform, please let me know. GraphBuilder is a Mac-only frontend.
