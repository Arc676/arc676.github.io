			Project Pathfinder involves the creation of a C++ library for graph related functions such as creating, modifying, storing, and loading weighted graphs as well as applying path-finding algorithms to determine the shortest route between any two nodes of a graph. Graphs are stored in plain text. The library currently only has a Dijkstra implementation as its sole path-finding function, but more may be added in the future.

		<p>
			The graph library can be compiled on any platform. If there are any troubles compiling on any platform, please let me know.
