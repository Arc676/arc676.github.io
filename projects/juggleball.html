			JuggleBall was created for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-18">18th Weekly Game Jam on itch.io</a>. The theme was Don't Drop It. JuggleBall is like Breakout, except there are no bricks and a new ball spawns every 10 seconds. The paddle follows the cursor and the objective is to keep as many balls in the air for as much time as possible. See the README for full gameplay details.
