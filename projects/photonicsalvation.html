			Photonic Salvation is the randomly generated, first person game with an overly dramatic title where you have to turn off all the lights, located at random positions in the world, and return to bed in as little time as possible. The project uses <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>, an open source 2D and 3D game engine. All assets are available under Creative Commons licenses. This project was created for <a href="https://itch.io/jam/7dfps-2020">7dfps</a> and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/procjam">PROCJAM</a> 2020.
