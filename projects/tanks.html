			Tanks is a strategy game based on an online Flash game of the same name. It can be easily found online simply by searching 'tanks flash game' or similar queries. The game has some bugs regarding shields and is no longer on the homepage of the original creators. My goal is to create my own version of this game and offer new mechanics and features not available in the original game. See the README file for more details.
