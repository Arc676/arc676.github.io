			Tanks is a strategy game based on an online Flash game of the same name. It can be easily found online simply by searching 'tanks flash game' or similar queries. The game has some bugs regarding shields and is no longer on the homepage of the original creators. My goal is to create my own version of this game and offer new mechanics and features not available in the original game. See the README file for more details.

			You can download the releases either from the <a href="https://github.com/Arc676/Tanks/releases">releases page</a> in the repository or from <a href="https://arc676.itch.io/tanks">itch.io</a>.

			Platform availability:
			<ul>
				<li>Mac
			</ul>
			I'm writing the code to be as modular as possible. Porting the project to iOS should be easy, so that might be available in the future. I'm also working on a cross platform version using Orx and Dear ImGui, but this might take a while. Currently, I'm not publishing the code because it might just be a lot of dead code, but if there is interest in this project, let me know.
