		<p>
			SockTalk is a socket-based, SSL-enabled IM library that can be used to create IM programs. A server program and a client program are included in the repository. One machine runs the server program and other users connect via the client program. Each user can specify a username and the chat can be hosted on any open port. Commands are used to disconnect, display connected users, etc. More details are available in the README.
		</p>
		<p>
			SockTalk is written in C++ and should be compatible with any desktop platform. The program has been run on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Mac. If it turns out it uses a platform specific library or feature, please let me know by <a href="https://github.com/Arc676/SockTalk/issues/new">opening an issue</a>.<br>
			Tested platforms:
			<ul>
				<li>Ubuntu
				<li>Mac
			</ul>
