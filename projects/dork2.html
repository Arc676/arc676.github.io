			Dork 2 is the 2D sequel to the text-based combat game, Dork (named after the popular 70s/80s Zork series). It uses the <a href="http://orx-project.com">Orx</a> library, like <a href="/projects/pixel.html">Pixel Shootout</a>. The original Dork was designed as a test to see if the implemented mechanics would be sufficient for an interesting combat game before I put the time into creating a full-scale 2D game. I always wanted to make a 2D version of Dork and had this project in mind for a long time, but put it off due to low interest in the original game. The mechanics needed a lot of work. However, the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/maximum-monster-month">Maximum Monster Month Game Jam</a> on <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> gave me the perfect opportunity to start working on this again. The original Dork is so bad it's not worth sharing. Let me know if, for some reason, you really want the source code to the original game.

			Platform availability:
			<ul>
				<li>Mac
					<p>
						Mac is the primary development platform. An Xcode project is included in the repository, as is the release build of the Orx library. You can download a compiled version of Dork 2 for Mac from either GitHub or itch.io.
					</p>
				<li>Linux
					<p>
						Linux is the secondary development platform. A Makefile is included in the repository for compilation on Linux. The release build of the Orx library for x86 platforms is included. A ZIP file containing the compiled binary and game assets is available for download from both GitHub and itch.io. The provided binary is for x86 platforms. If you are using a different architechture, if it's supported by Orx, you can compile the library and game yourself.
					</p>
				<li>Windows
					<p>
						Windows is only used for testing and ensuring that the project compiles and runs properly on the platform. At any given time, the included Visual Studio 2017 project is likely to be most behind. The release build of the Orx library is included in the repository as well. You can download the compiled EXE file and game assets compressed in a ZIP file from GitHub or itch.io.
