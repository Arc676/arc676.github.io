			Dork 2 is the 2D sequel to the text-based combat game, Dork (named after the popular 70s/80s Zork series). It uses the <a href="http://orx-project.com">Orx</a> library, like <a href="/projects/pixel.html">Pixel Shootout</a>. The original Dork was designed as a test to see if the implemented mechanics would be sufficient for an interesting combat game before I put the time into creating a full-scale 2D game. I always wanted to make a 2D version of Dork and had this project in mind for a long time, but put it off due to low interest in the original game. The mechanics needed a lot of work. However, the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/maximum-monster-month">Maximum Monster Month Game Jam</a> on <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> gave me the perfect opportunity to start working on this again. The original Dork is so bad it's not worth sharing. Let me know if, for some reason, you really want the source code to the original game.

			Check out the README for more details about the gameplay. You can download Dork 2 from <a href="https://github.com/Arc676/Dork-2/releases">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://arc676.itch.io/dork-2">itch.io</a>.

			Dork 2 is based on Orx, so it can be compiled on any platform. You may need to compile the Orx library for your platform. The repository includes a Visual Studio 2017 project and a Makefile. You can download the binaries for Mac and Windows from either source (Linux binary coming soon).
