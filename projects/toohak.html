			<a href="https://kahoot.it">Kahoot!</a> is an online quiz game platform. One user starts a quiz (hosted on the Kahoot's servers) and other players connect to the game via a web or mobile app. Questions and answers appear on the host user's computer and the players answer the multiple choice questions by clicking the appropriate answer on their devices. Project Toohak (Kahoot backwards) is a free, open source, socket- and LAN-based version of this game with the addition of some extra features. These can be found in the README. Its purpose is to serve as a suitable replacement for Kahoot! when network latency makes the game unfair to players with a bad connection by being playable on the local network.

			Toohak is written in Java, so it can be run on any Java-compatible platform.
