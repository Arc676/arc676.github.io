		<p>
			The FoodTracker library is designed to help people keep track of the food in their cupboards and refrigerators. If you often forget what you have and when it spoils, this library may be for you. The repository includes a simple command line client that takes advantage of the library's features, but you can create your own client and design your own interface. If you think the library should have a certain feature, feel free to fork and make a pull request, or <a href="https://github.com/Arc676/Food-Tracker/issues/new">open a new issue</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			FoodTracker is a C++ library and should be compilable on any platform.
