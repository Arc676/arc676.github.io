Let's move on to something harder.

All variables have something called a "type". This tells the computer 
what kind of information it contains.
Here are some examples of the simplest variable types you will learn to 
use in Python:

String 		"hello"
int (integer) 	5
float 		2.5

Each type has special properties that make it different from the others.

Rules:
1) You cannot do math with a string
2) You cannot get a decimal with an integer
3) Any variable of type float will NEVER be 100% precise

Notes to each of these rules:
1) You can use the plus operator with strings. This concatenates them 
	together (e.g. "hello " + "world!" gives "hello world!")
2) If you try to get a fraction by diving an integer (such as 1/2) you 
	will get the rounded down value (1/2 gives 0)
3) IMPORTANT: floats are not pefect. Some operations will work better 
	than others, but never rely on floats for exact values.

	2.2: Type conversion

Sometimes, you will have to convert variables to other types. You have 
learned to use the raw_input() command. This gives you a string.
You can convert this to an integer using the int() statement:

number = raw_input() #number is now a string
number = int(number) #number is now an integer

You can convert to a float by using float(). To convert something to a 
string, use the str() statement.

===			====

Task: Write a program that asks the user for a fractional value (such as 
	0.5). Convert this input to a float and print the float value.
Extension: Try to convert the input to an integer. This won't work. Why 
	do you think that is?
