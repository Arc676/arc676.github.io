	7.3	Commenting

The one thing no one wants to do but everyone should do: commenting.

A comment is some text that you can put in your program that isn't treated as code.
This means you can make notes to yourself or explain to other people who might read
your code what it does. If you pursue a career in computer science, you will likely
have to work in a team at some point with other programmers. This is when you will
want to be able to understand what other people's code does and others will want to
understand what yours does. Comments in Python are preceded by a hash sign.

	#This is a comment

Commenting your code is very important because it's easy to forget what a piece of
code was meant to do or why you wrote it the way you did.

Examples when this might happen:
-you gave a variable an arbitrary name when it needed a good name
-you are returning to a project you started a long tme ago
-you got help online (or found code online) instead of writing it yourself
-you wrote a very complicated algorithm to solve a very complex task (while you
	might not forget the purpose, it's easy to forget how it works)

Task: at some point, comment all of your code. This is so you can review it later
	without using the task files from this ECA.
