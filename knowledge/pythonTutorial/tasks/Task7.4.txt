	7.4 Nesting functions

The point of having a function that returns a variable is that you can use it as
one. This means you can put a function inside another function as if it were a
variable.

	myVariable = functionA(functionB())

This can be used to reduce the number of lines as well as avoid creating any
temporary variables.

	def foo():
		return [1, 2, 3]

	x = foo()[1] #=> 2

	userInput = int(raw_input("Enter a number: "))
