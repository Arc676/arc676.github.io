Welcome to the command line interface! Unlike your usual computer 
experience, you no longer have icons or a cursor.

Trust me, this is better.

	1.2.1: Basic commands and moving around the filesystem

You should see this:
pi@raspberrypi ~$

The 'pi' part is your username. The 'raspberrypi' part is the computer 
name or hostname. The '~' part is the directory you are currently in. 
The tilde character ~ represents your home directory, /home/pi here and 
/users/yourname on your normal everyday computers. The dollar sign 
represents the fact that you are not a superuser.

To run a command, type the command and press enter. The 'echo' command 
simply echoes some text onto the screen.

Run the following command now:
echo Hello world!

Now that you only have a keyboard and text, you will need to learn how 
to move around the filesystem. Use the 'cd' command to Change Directory. 
For example, if you have a folder called "stuff", 'cd stuff' will take 
you to that directory. But how do you know what directories there are? 
Use the 'ls' command. To move up the file tree (aka move into the parent 
folder) use 'cd ..'. '..' always represents the parent directory.

Try to use the ls and cd commands right now to move around the 
filesystem on your Pi. See what you find.

	1.2.2: Essential commands

Moving around isn't enough. We want to do stuff. Here are some basic 
commands:

mv: MoVe files
	mv sourceFile destinationFolderOrName
cp: CoPy files
	cp sourceFile destnationFolderOrName

You can accidentally overwrite stuff with these commands. Be careful!

rm: ReMove (or delete) files
	rm filename

mkdir: MaKe a DIRectory
	mkdir directoryName
rmdir: ReMove (or delete) a DIRectory
	rmdir directoryName

The directory has to be empty to be deleted.

man: get the MANual page
	man manPageName

Try to get the manual pages for the commands you just learned.

python: runs the python interpreter or python programs
	python myprogram.py
	python
		(simply runs the interpreter)

nano: This is a text editor. You should write your programs with this. 
	Remember to save your work when exiting.
