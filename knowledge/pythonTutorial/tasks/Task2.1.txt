Let's start with basic I/O using Python 2.7.
I/O means input/output.

	2.1.1: Printing to the console

To output to the console, use the print command. Example:

print "This will be printed to the console"

===			====

Task: Write a program to print the text "Hello world!" to the console

===			====

	2.1.2: Variables

Variables are used to store data. You have to give them a unique name, 
or identifier. Assign them values using the equals sign (=)

someNumber = 0

You can print variables using the print command. Taking many values and 
stringing them together is callled concatenation. You can concatenate strings
by using a comma (,) when printing:

answer = 42
print "The answer to life, the universe, and everything is", answer

===			====

Task: Write a program with some variables. Then print them to the 
console, both with and without concatenating text.
Extension: If you are feeling confident, try concatenating multiple 
variables and/or strings and printing them all at once.

===			====

	2.1.3: Getting user input

To get input from the user, use the raw_input() command. You can include 
a prompt between the parentheses.

Example:

name = raw_input("Enter your name: ")

===			====

Task: Write a program that asks the user for their name. Then print a 
	greeting to the console including their name.
Hint: Use everything you have learned so far to complete this task.
