			This part of my website is unlikely to be updated very often. This is where I intend to share random stuff that may or may not be code related. The common aspect is that these things don't really need a repository, as in they don't need version control because I won't be modifying them all that much. This is also where I intend to dump any knowledge that happens to be in a well written or well organized format.
