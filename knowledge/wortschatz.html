			If you've read my <a href="/me/about.html">About page</a>, you'll know that I speak German. I also happen to have over 2000 terms on Quizlet. If you're also learning German and are interested in expanding your vocabulary or using Quizlet tools to practice/revise words, the sets are available to be used by anyone. You can access my German folder <a href="https://quizlet.com/Arc676/folders/deutsch/sets">here</a>.

			If you don't want to use Quizlet, you can also download the sets as text. These files are unlikely to be updated, as I no longer update these Quizlet sets. Each line contains a new term with the format <tt>German term//English definition</tt>, for example: <tt>abfahren//to drive away</tt>. The files are sorted alphabetically by German term. Each file contains terms from a different set, which are separated by word type. Two of the Quizlet sets (nationalities and German Bundesl√§nder) are not available as files.
